# Rick and Morty App - test

This app displays the image of a Rick and Morty character if the provided name matches one.

## Assumptions

- Only one image is displayed.
- Only exact matches (full names) will be shown, no subsets or partial names.
- I can perform a name query using the provided API.

## How to start the project (React Native + Expo)

It utilizes Expo Go. I was only able to test it on iOS devices because I could not start the Android simulator on my 2017 MacBook.

```sh
npm install
```

&

```sh
npm run ios
```

OR

```sh
npm start
```
